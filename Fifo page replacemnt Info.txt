🧩 Program Overview

Concept: FIFO (First In First Out) Page Replacement

Goal: Simulate how pages are replaced in memory when a new page needs to be loaded

Inputs:

Number of frames (physical memory slots)

Number of pages (length of reference string)

The reference string (sequence of page requests)

Outputs:

Step-by-step page replacement process

Total page hits and faults

🧠 Line-by-Line Explanation
Import package
import java.util.*;


Imports Java’s utility package which includes:

Scanner for user input

Queue and LinkedList for FIFO queue operations

Class Declaration
public class FIFO_PageReplacement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {


Defines the main class FIFO_PageReplacement.

main() is the entry point of the program.

Step 1 – Input number of frames
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("Enter number of frames: ");
int framesCount = sc.nextInt();


Creates a Scanner object to take input.

Prompts user for number of frames — the number of pages that can be held in memory at one time.

📘 Example:
If framesCount = 3, it means memory can hold only 3 pages simultaneously.

Step 2 – Input number of pages
System.out.print("Enter number of pages: ");
int pagesCount = sc.nextInt();


Asks how many pages are in the reference string (sequence of pages requested by CPU).

Step 3 – Input reference string
int[] pages = new int[pagesCount];

System.out.println("Enter the reference string:");
for (int i = 0; i < pagesCount; i++) {
    pages[i] = sc.nextInt();
}


Creates an array pages[] to store the page reference sequence.

Example input:

7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3


represents the order of page requests from memory.

Step 4 – Initialize FIFO Queue
Queue<Integer> frames = new LinkedList<>();
int pageFaults = 0, pageHits = 0;


frames: represents the memory using a queue (FIFO behavior).

The first inserted page is the first to be removed.

pageFaults: counts how many times a new page had to be brought into memory.

pageHits: counts how many times the requested page was already in memory.

Step 5 – Begin simulation
System.out.println("\nPage Replacement Process (FIFO):");


Prints a heading for the simulation steps.

Step 6 – Process each page one by one
for (int i = 0; i < pagesCount; i++) {
    int currentPage = pages[i];


Loops through all pages in the reference string.

currentPage holds the page currently being requested by the CPU.

Step 7 – Check for page hit or fault
if (frames.contains(currentPage)) {
    // Page Hit
    pageHits++;
    System.out.println("Page " + currentPage + " => HIT   | Frames: " + frames);
} else {
    // Page Fault
    pageFaults++;
    if (frames.size() == framesCount) {
        int removed = frames.poll(); // remove oldest page
        System.out.println("Page " + removed + " removed.");
    }
    frames.add(currentPage);
    System.out.println("Page " + currentPage + " => FAULT | Frames: " + frames);
}


Now let’s break this logic:

🔹 Case 1: Page Hit
if (frames.contains(currentPage)) {
    pageHits++;
    System.out.println("Page " + currentPage + " => HIT   | Frames: " + frames);
}


Checks if the current page already exists in the frames (memory).

If yes → Page Hit (no need to replace anything).

Displays the current frame content.

🔹 Case 2: Page Fault
else {
    pageFaults++;
    if (frames.size() == framesCount) {
        int removed = frames.poll();
        System.out.println("Page " + removed + " removed.");
    }
    frames.add(currentPage);
    System.out.println("Page " + currentPage + " => FAULT | Frames: " + frames);
}


Page Fault occurs when the requested page is not in memory.

Steps:

Increase fault count.

If memory is full (frames.size() == framesCount):

Remove the oldest page using poll() → FIFO removal.

Display which page was removed.

Add the new page to memory using add().

Display updated frame content.

📘 FIFO Rule:
The page that entered first leaves first when memory is full.

Step 8 – Display totals
System.out.println("\nTotal Page Hits   = " + pageHits);
System.out.println("Total Page Faults = " + pageFaults);


Prints the final results after all pages are processed.

Step 9 – Close scanner
sc.close();


Releases system resources used by the Scanner object.

🧮 Example Execution
Input:
Enter number of frames: 3
Enter number of pages: 7
Enter the reference string:
1 3 0 3 5 6 3

Output:
Page Replacement Process (FIFO):
Page 1 => FAULT | Frames: [1]
Page 3 => FAULT | Frames: [1, 3]
Page 0 => FAULT | Frames: [1, 3, 0]
Page 3 => HIT   | Frames: [1, 3, 0]
Page 5 removed.
Page 1 removed.
Page 5 => FAULT | Frames: [3, 0, 5]
Page 6 removed.
Page 3 removed.
Page 6 => FAULT | Frames: [0, 5, 6]
Page 3 => FAULT | Frames: [5, 6, 3]

Total Page Hits   = 1
Total Page Faults = 6

📘 Concept Recap
Term	Meaning
Page Hit	Page is already in memory
Page Fault	Page not in memory → must be loaded
FIFO	Replace the oldest loaded page first
Queue	Best structure for FIFO (first in, first out)
🧠 Algorithm Summary

Initialize an empty queue for frames.

For each page request:

If page exists → HIT.

Else → FAULT.

If memory full → remove oldest page.

Add new page to queue.

Count total hits and faults.

Display the process.
