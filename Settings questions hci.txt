1. Types of real-time applications of HCI

ATMs and kiosks

Mobile apps (WhatsApp, Instagram)

Airplane cockpits and dashboards

Gaming systems

Smart home devices (Alexa, Google Home)

🟢 HCI helps make these systems easy and safe to use.

2. Types of memory

Short-term memory – stores small info for a few seconds (like OTP).

Long-term memory – stores knowledge and experience permanently.

Sensory memory – holds visual or sound info for a very short time.

3. Principles of good design and bad interface

Good design: Simple, consistent, fast feedback, user control.
Bad interface: Confusing layout, too many colors, unclear buttons, no feedback.

4. Miller’s Law

Humans can remember 7 ± 2 items at a time in short-term memory.
🟢 So, interfaces should avoid showing too many options at once.

5. Interaction styles (with pros, cons & example)
Style	Example	Advantages	Disadvantages
Command line	Windows CMD	Fast for experts	Hard for beginners
Menu selection	ATM, mobile	Easy to learn	Slow for experts
Form fill-in	Online forms	Structured input	Limited flexibility
Direct manipulation	Drag-drop in mobile	Intuitive, visual	Needs graphics
Natural language	Voice assistants	User-friendly	May misinterpret
6. Ergonomics for UX/UI

Designing interfaces that match human comfort and efficiency:

Proper button size & spacing

Readable fonts and contrast

Easy reach on mobile screens

Reduces strain and errors

7. How 8 Golden Rules are applicable to your Figma design

In WhatsApp prototype:

Consistency in screens

Shortcuts like “Send” button

Clear feedback (ticks for messages)

Easy navigation (back, home icons)

Error prevention (confirmation before delete)

8. Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design (Ben Shneiderman)

Strive for consistency

Enable shortcuts

Offer informative feedback

Design dialogs to yield closure

Offer error prevention and simple handling

Permit easy reversal of actions (undo)

Support internal locus of control (user in charge)

Reduce short-term memory load

9. Intranet vs Internet
Intranet	Internet
Private network (organization use)	Public global network
Limited access	Open access
More secure	Less secure
Example: Office portal	Example: Google, YouTube
10. GUI vs Web Application
GUI App	Web App
Runs on local system	Runs in browser
Needs installation	No installation
Example: Paint, VLC	Example: Gmail, WhatsApp Web
11. Types of UX/UI Evaluation

Heuristic evaluation (expert checks rules)

User testing (real users test app)

Cognitive walkthrough (step-by-step analysis)

Surveys & interviews

A/B testing

12. GOMS Model

GOMS = Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules
Used to analyze how users perform tasks and measure efficiency.
🟢 Helps find faster ways for users to complete actions.

13. Heuristic Evaluation

Experts evaluate interface using 10 usability heuristics (like feedback, consistency, error prevention).
🟢 Helps find design issues early before user testing.

14. Cognitive Walkthrough

Experts simulate a user’s thought process step-by-step to check how easily new users can learn the interface.

15. Paradigms for Interaction

Desktop paradigm – windows, icons, menus.

Ubiquitous computing – smart devices everywhere.

Virtual reality / AR – immersive interfaces.

Conversational UI – chatbots, voice assistants.

16. Five Stage Search Framework

Define the problem

Select source

Formulate query

Execute search

Examine & refine results

🟢 Used in search engines and databases.

17. Dynamic Queries and Faceted Search

Dynamic queries: Results update instantly as you change filters (e.g., price slider on Amazon).

Faceted search: Filters by categories (e.g., brand, price, color).

18. Designing for 10-foot interfaces principles

(Used for TVs / large displays where user sits ~10 feet away)

Large text and icons

High contrast

Simple navigation (remote control)

Minimal typing

Fewer on-screen elements
