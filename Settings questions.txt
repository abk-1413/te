1. Input and Output of Pass I and Pass II of Assembler and Macro

Pass I:
Input – Source program
Output – Symbol table, intermediate code

Pass II:
Input – Intermediate code, symbol table
Output – Object code

Macro:
Expands macro definitions during assembly.

2. What is Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling?

Preemptive: CPU can be taken from a process before it finishes (e.g. Round Robin).

Non-Preemptive: Process keeps CPU until it finishes (e.g. FCFS).

3. What is Turnaround Time, Response Time, Waiting Time?

Turnaround Time: Completion time – Arrival time

Response Time: First response – Arrival time

Waiting Time: Turnaround time – Burst time

4. Which algorithm is best when FCFS, RR, Priority and SJF are compared?

SJF (Shortest Job First) gives minimum average waiting and turnaround time.

5. Which algorithm is best when LRU, Optimal and FIFO are compared?

Optimal is best (least page faults),

LRU is better than FIFO in practice.

6. What is Macro and Assembler?

Macro: A single instruction that expands into a set of instructions.

Assembler: Converts assembly language into machine code.

7. Why Banker's Algorithm is required?

To avoid deadlock by checking safe resource allocation before granting resources.

8. What is Deadlock? Four Necessary Conditions?

Deadlock – When processes wait forever for resources.
Conditions:

Mutual Exclusion

Hold and Wait

No Preemption

Circular Wait

9. Example of FCFS, RR, SJF, Priority Scheduling

(Explain briefly in viva using small example)

FCFS: First come first served.

SJF: Process with smallest burst time first.

RR: Each process gets fixed time slice.

Priority: Process with highest priority first.

10. Example of FIFO, Optimal, LRU Page Replacement

FIFO: Oldest page replaced first.

Optimal: Page not needed for longest time replaced.

LRU: Least recently used page replaced.

11. Difference between Pass I and Pass II of Assembler
Pass I	Pass II
Creates symbol table	Uses symbol table
Generates intermediate code	Generates final object code
12. Drawback of Pass I of Assembler

It cannot generate object code directly.

Requires second pass for address resolution.

13. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter
Compiler	Interpreter
Translates whole program at once	Translates line by line
Faster execution	Slower execution
14. In which parts Assembly Language is divided?

Machine-dependent part

Machine-independent part

15. What is Process? States of Process

Process – Program in execution.
States: New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated.

16. What is Paging?

Memory management technique dividing memory into fixed-size blocks (pages & frames).

17. What is Segmentation?

Memory divided into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions like code, data, stack.

18. What is Pages and Frames?

Page: Part of process in logical memory.

Frame: Part of physical memory.

19. Why need of CPU Scheduling Algorithm?

To use CPU efficiently, reduce waiting time, and improve system performance.

20. Types of Scheduling + Explain Long, Medium, Short Term

Long Term Scheduler: Selects which process to admit (job scheduling).

Medium Term: Swaps processes between main memory and disk.

Short Term: Chooses which process runs next on CPU.
