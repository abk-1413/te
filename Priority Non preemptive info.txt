🧩 1. Import & Class Declaration
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PriorityNonPreemptiveEasy {


import java.util.Scanner; → Imports the Scanner class used for user input from the console.

public class PriorityNonPreemptiveEasy → Declares the class (name suggests it's a simplified version of priority scheduling).

🧠 2. main() method and Scanner
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);


Defines the main entry point of the program.

Creates a Scanner object sc for reading input from the user (keyboard).

🏁 3. Take the number of processes
        // Input number of processes
        System.out.print("Enter number of processes: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();


Prompts the user for total number of processes to schedule.

Stores that number in n.

📊 4. Declare arrays for process data
        int[] bt = new int[n];   // Burst times
        int[] pr = new int[n];   // Priorities
        int[] wt = new int[n];   // Waiting times
        int[] tat = new int[n];  // Turnaround times
        int[] pid = new int[n];  // Process IDs


Each array is of size n:

bt[i]: Burst Time (execution time required by process i).

pr[i]: Priority of process i (smaller number = higher priority).

wt[i]: Waiting time of process i.

tat[i]: Turnaround time (waiting time + burst time).

pid[i]: Process IDs (e.g., P1, P2, P3...).

💬 5. Input burst times & priorities
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter burst time for Process " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            bt[i] = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.print("Enter priority for Process " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            pr[i] = sc.nextInt();
            pid[i] = i + 1;
        }


Loops through each process index i (0 to n-1).

Takes user input for:

Burst time,

Priority.

Assigns process ID as (i+1) (so process 1, 2, 3, ...).

🧠 Example input:

Enter number of processes: 3
Enter burst time for Process 1: 4
Enter priority for Process 1: 2
Enter burst time for Process 2: 3
Enter priority for Process 2: 1
Enter burst time for Process 3: 5
Enter priority for Process 3: 3

🔄 6. Sort processes by priority
        // Sort processes by priority (lower number = higher priority)
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (pr[i] > pr[j]) {
                    // swap priority
                    int temp = pr[i];
                    pr[i] = pr[j];
                    pr[j] = temp;

                    // swap burst time
                    temp = bt[i];
                    bt[i] = bt[j];
                    bt[j] = temp;

                    // swap process id
                    temp = pid[i];
                    pid[i] = pid[j];
                    pid[j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }

Explanation:

The nested loops sort the processes in ascending order of priority.

If pr[i] > pr[j], it means process i has lower priority (since higher number means lower priority), so we swap them.

Whenever we swap priorities, we also swap:

Corresponding burst times (bt),

And process IDs (pid).

🧠 So after sorting, all arrays are aligned properly — highest priority process comes first.

Example (before & after sorting):

PID	BT	Priority
P1	4	2
P2	3	1
P3	5	3

After sorting:

PID	BT	Priority
P2	3	1
P1	4	2
P3	5	3
⏱️ 7. Calculate Waiting Time (WT) & Turnaround Time (TAT)
        // Calculate waiting time and turnaround time
        wt[0] = 0;
        tat[0] = bt[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            wt[i] = wt[i - 1] + bt[i - 1];
            tat[i] = wt[i] + bt[i];
        }

Step-by-step:

First process always has 0 waiting time because it starts immediately.

Turnaround time for first process = burst time (since no wait).

For each subsequent process:

Waiting time = sum of burst times of all previous processes.

Turnaround time = its own burst time + its waiting time.

🧮 Example:

PID	BT	WT	TAT
P2	3	0	3
P1	4	3	7
P3	5	7	12
🖨️ 8. Display Output Table
        // Print results
        System.out.println("\nProcess\tBurst Time\tPriority\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time");
        System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------------------");

        int totalWT = 0, totalTAT = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.printf("P%-7d%-15d%-15d%-15d%-15d%n",
                    pid[i], bt[i], pr[i], wt[i], tat[i]);
            totalWT += wt[i];
            totalTAT += tat[i];
        }

Breakdown:

Prints header for the output table.

Iterates through each process and prints:

Process ID

Burst Time

Priority

Waiting Time

Turnaround Time

Uses System.out.printf for aligned, neat table formatting.

Accumulates total waiting and turnaround times to calculate averages later.

🧾 Example output:

Process Burst Time   Priority   Waiting Time   Turnaround Time
---------------------------------------------------------------
P2      3             1           0              3
P1      4             2           3              7
P3      5             3           7              12

📈 9. Calculate and Print Averages
        // Print averages
        System.out.println("\nAverage Waiting Time = " + (float) totalWT / n);
        System.out.println("Average Turnaround Time = " + (float) totalTAT / n);


Divides total waiting time and turnaround time by number of processes.

Casts to float for decimal results.

Displays average waiting and turnaround times.

Example:

Average Waiting Time = 3.3333333
Average Turnaround Time = 7.3333333

🔚 10. Close the Scanner
        sc.close();
    }
}


Closes the Scanner object to free resources.

🧮 Final Example (Full run)

Input:

Enter number of processes: 3
Enter burst time for Process 1: 4
Enter priority for Process 1: 2
Enter burst time for Process 2: 3
Enter priority for Process 2: 1
Enter burst time for Process 3: 5
Enter priority for Process 3: 3


Output:

Process Burst Time   Priority   Waiting Time   Turnaround Time
---------------------------------------------------------------
P2      3             1           0              3
P1      4             2           3              7
P3      5             3           7              12

Average Waiting Time = 3.3333333
Average Turnaround Time = 7.3333333

⚙️ Summary of Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Priority Scheduling	Each process has a priority number; lower number means higher priority.
Non-preemptive	Once a process starts, it runs until completion. No interruption.
Waiting Time (WT)	Time process waits in ready queue before execution.
Turnaround Time (TAT)	Total time from arrival to completion (WT + BT).
Sorting	Processes are sorted by priority before calculating WT and TAT.
