🧩 Program Overview

Algorithm: FCFS (non-preemptive)

Goal: Schedule processes in order of their arrival times and compute:

Completion Time (CT)

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Waiting Time (WT)

Swapping: Used to sort processes by arrival time before execution

🧠 Line-by-Line Explanation
Import
import java.util.*;


Imports all classes from the java.util package.

Needed here for the Scanner class (for user input).

Class Declaration
public class FCFS_Swapping {
    public static void main(String[] args) {


Defines the main class FCFS_Swapping.

main() is the entry point of the program.

Step 1 – Input number of processes
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter number of processes: ");
int n = sc.nextInt();


Creates a Scanner object to take input.

Reads the number of processes n.

Declaring Arrays
int pid[] = new int[n]; // Process IDs
int at[] = new int[n];  // Arrival Times
int bt[] = new int[n];  // Burst Times
int ct[] = new int[n];  // Completion Times
int tat[] = new int[n]; // Turnaround Times
int wt[] = new int[n];  // Waiting Times


Each array holds data for n processes:

pid: Process ID (P1, P2, …)

at: Arrival Time

bt: Burst Time

ct: Completion Time

tat: Turnaround Time

wt: Waiting Time

Step 2 – Input process details
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    pid[i] = i + 1;
    System.out.print("Enter arrival time for P" + pid[i] + ": ");
    at[i] = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter burst time for P" + pid[i] + ": ");
    bt[i] = sc.nextInt();
}


Loops through each process:

Assigns process ID as P1, P2, etc.

Takes user input for:

Arrival time (at[i])

Burst time (bt[i])

Step 3 – Sorting by Arrival Time
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if (at[i] > at[j]) {
            // Swap arrival time
            int temp = at[i];
            at[i] = at[j];
            at[j] = temp;

            // Swap burst time
            temp = bt[i];
            bt[i] = bt[j];
            bt[j] = temp;

            // Swap process ID
            temp = pid[i];
            pid[i] = pid[j];
            pid[j] = temp;
        }
    }
}


🔁 This section sorts the processes in ascending order of Arrival Time (AT).

FCFS executes processes as they arrive, so sorting ensures correct order.

Swapping is used to maintain alignment between arrival times, burst times, and process IDs.

Example:
Before sort → AT = [5, 1, 2]
After sort → AT = [1, 2, 5]

Step 4 – Calculate Completion Time (CT)
ct[0] = at[0] + bt[0]; // First process
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (at[i] > ct[i - 1]) {
        // CPU is idle until process arrives
        ct[i] = at[i] + bt[i];
    } else {
        ct[i] = ct[i - 1] + bt[i];
    }
}


🧮 Logic:

For first process: CT = AT + BT

For others:

If CPU becomes idle (next process arrives after previous finishes):

Start new process when it arrives: CT = AT + BT

Otherwise:

Start immediately after last completion: CT = previous CT + BT

Example:

Process	AT	BT	CT
P1	0	3	3
P2	2	4	7
P3	5	2	9
Step 5 – Calculate TAT & WT
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    tat[i] = ct[i] - at[i];
    wt[i] = tat[i] - bt[i];
}


Formulas:

Turnaround Time (TAT) = CT - AT

Waiting Time (WT) = TAT - BT

These are standard scheduling metrics:

Term	Meaning
TAT	Total time a process spends in the system
WT	Time a process waits in the ready queue
Step 6 – Display Results
System.out.println("\nPID\tAT\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println("P" + pid[i] + "\t" + at[i] + "\t" + bt[i] +
            "\t" + ct[i] + "\t" + tat[i] + "\t" + wt[i]);
}


🖨️ Prints all calculated values in a neat tabular format:

PID	AT	BT	CT	TAT	WT
P1	0	4	4	4	0
P2	1	3	7	6	3
P3	2	2	9	7	5

Close Scanner
sc.close();


Frees the input stream resource.

🧠 Key Takeaways

FCFS is non-preemptive (once process starts, it runs till completion).

Processes are executed in order of arrival.

If CPU becomes idle (gap between CT and next AT), it waits.

This version sorts processes by Arrival Time using swapping, hence the name FCFS_Swapping
